## Region of Convergence Continued

### Properties

1. The Region of Convergence consist of a ring centered around the origin.
2. The Discrete-Time Fourier Transform of $x[n]$ is convergent if and only if the Region of Convergence of the Z-Transform of $x[n]$ contains the unit circle.
3. The Region of Convergence does not contain any poles.
4. If $x[n]$ is of finite duration, then the Region of Convergence is the entire z-plane, except possibly $z = 0$ or $z = \infty$.
5. If $x[n]$ is a *right-sided* sequence the Region of Convergence extends outward from the outermost finite pole (possibly to $z = \infty$).
6. If $x[n]$ is a *left-sided* sequence the Region of Convergence extends inward from the innermost finite pole (possibly including $z=0$).
7. If $x[n]$ is a *two-sided* sequence then the Region of Convergence is a ring bounded by interior and exterior poles.
8. The Region of convergence must be a connect region.
9. If $x[n]$ and $y[n]$ have Regions of Convergence, $R_x$ and $R_y$, then a linear combination, $v[n] = ax[n] + by[n]$, will have the Region of Convergence that include the Regions of Convergence of $x[n]$ and $y[n]$, $R_v \supseteq R_x \cap R_y$.

__These properties will be provided on the midterm.__

#### Example

*Find the region of convergence of*

$$\begin{aligned}
    X(z) = \frac{1}{
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{3}z^{-1} \right)
    \left( 1 - 2z^{-1} \right)
    }
\end{aligned}$$
