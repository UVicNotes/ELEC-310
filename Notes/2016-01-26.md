# Lecture 10 - Notes  

**January 26, 2016**  

We are going over what happened last week again this week.

## Convolution Properties

### Commutativity

$$
    x * h = h * x
$$

### Associativity

$$
    x * (y  * h) = (x  * g)  * h
$$

### Distributivity

$$
    x  * (y + h) = (x  * y) + (y  * h)
$$

### Associativity with scalar multiplication

$$
    a (y  * g) = (a f)  * g
$$

## LTI Systems from their Unit Impulse

### Causal

_definition_: A Linear time invariant system is **causal** if the unit impulse, $h[n]$, is zero for all $n$ greater than zero, i.e.,

$$
    h[n] = 0 \text{ for all } n > 0
$$

### Stability

_definition_: A Linear time invariant system is **stable** if and only if,

$$
    \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \left| h[n] \right| \lt \infty
$$

and $h[n]$ is _absolutely summable_ (a finite energy signal).

### Invertibility

 _definition_: A linear time invariant system is **invertible** if we can find another system that can perfectly reverse the transform of the system. In terms of $h[n]$ the system is invertible if there exist $h^\prime[n]$ such that,
 
 $$
    h[n] * h^\prime[n] = \delta[n].
